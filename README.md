# VideoGallery platform 

This is a simple video hosting application built with Python and Flask. It allows users to upload video files, which are then stored and can be played back through a custom HTML5 video player. The application supports uploading multiple video files for a single video entry, allowing for different quality options (e.g., 1080p, 720p). <br>
